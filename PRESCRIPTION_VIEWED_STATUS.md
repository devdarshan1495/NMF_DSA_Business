# Prescription "Viewed" Status Implementation

## Overview
Added a new "viewed" status to track when pharmacists view a prescription for the first time. This provides better tracking of prescription lifecycle.

## Status Flow
```
active â†’ viewed â†’ filled
```

1. **active**: Prescription created by doctor, not yet viewed by pharmacist
2. **viewed**: Prescription has been viewed by pharmacist but not yet dispensed
3. **filled**: Prescription has been dispensed to patient

## Changes Made

### 1. Pharmacist.js Updates

#### Fixed Verify Form Initialization
**Problem**: Form event listener was being attached before DOM was ready
**Solution**: Created `initializeVerifyForm()` function that runs after DOM loads

```javascript
function initializeVerifyForm() {
    verifyForm = document.getElementById('verify-form');
    resultsContainer = document.getElementById('results-container');
    
    if (verifyForm) {
        verifyForm.addEventListener('submit', handleVerifySubmit);
        console.log('âœ… Verify form initialized successfully');
    }
}
```

#### Auto-Update to "Viewed" Status
When a pharmacist verifies/views a prescription:
- Status automatically updates from "active" to "viewed"
- Records `viewedDate` and `viewedAt` timestamps in Firebase

```javascript
// Update status to "viewed" when pharmacist views it
if (prescriptionData.status === 'active') {
    await updatePrescriptionStatus(prescriptionId, 'viewed');
    prescriptionData.status = 'viewed';
    console.log('âœ… Prescription status updated to "viewed"');
}
```

#### New Function: updatePrescriptionStatus()
Updates prescription status in Firebase with timestamps:

```javascript
async function updatePrescriptionStatus(prescriptionId, newStatus) {
    await updateDoc(doc(db, 'prescriptions', prescriptionId), {
        status: newStatus,
        viewedDate: newStatus === 'viewed' ? new Date().toISOString() : null,
        viewedAt: newStatus === 'viewed' ? new Date().toISOString() : null
    });
}
```

#### Updated Stats to Include "Viewed"
**Pending Verification** now counts both "active" and "viewed" prescriptions:

```javascript
const pendingCount = allPrescriptions.filter(p => 
    p.status === 'active' || p.status === 'viewed'
).length;
```

### 2. Firebase Data Structure

#### New Fields Added to Prescriptions
```javascript
{
    prescriptionId: "20251007-452970039",
    status: "viewed", // NEW: Can now be "viewed"
    viewedDate: "2025-10-07T15:30:00.000Z", // NEW: When viewed
    viewedAt: "2025-10-07T15:30:00.000Z", // NEW: Alternative timestamp
    filledDate: null, // Set when marked as filled
    // ... other fields
}
```

### 3. Prescription Lifecycle Tracking

#### Timeline Example:
```
1. Doctor creates prescription
   - status: "active"
   - issueDate: "2025-10-07T10:00:00.000Z"

2. Pharmacist views prescription
   - status: "viewed" (auto-updated)
   - viewedDate: "2025-10-07T15:30:00.000Z"

3. Pharmacist marks as filled
   - status: "filled"
   - filledDate: "2025-10-07T15:45:00.000Z"
```

### 4. Dashboard Statistics

#### Updated Counts:
- **Verified Today**: Prescriptions marked as "filled" today
- **Pending Verification**: Prescriptions with "active" OR "viewed" status
- **Total Verified**: All prescriptions with "filled" status

## Benefits

1. âœ… **Better Tracking**: Know when pharmacist first saw the prescription
2. âœ… **Audit Trail**: Complete timeline from creation â†’ view â†’ filling
3. âœ… **Workflow Visibility**: See which prescriptions are being reviewed
4. âœ… **Analytics**: Track time between creation, viewing, and filling
5. âœ… **Status Clarity**: Distinguish between unseen and pending prescriptions

## How It Works

### For Pharmacists:
1. Enter prescription ID and click "Verify Prescription"
2. System automatically updates status to "viewed" (if currently "active")
3. Prescription details are displayed
4. Click "Mark as Filled" when dispensing medication

### Status Badges:
- ðŸŸ¢ **ACTIVE**: New prescription, not yet viewed
- ðŸŸ¡ **VIEWED**: Pharmacist has reviewed, awaiting dispensing
- âœ… **FILLED**: Medication has been dispensed

## Technical Details

### Event Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Verify Prescription" button
2. handleVerifySubmit() called
3. Fetch prescription from Firebase
4. Check current status:
   - If "active" â†’ Update to "viewed"
   - If "viewed" â†’ Show details
   - If "filled" â†’ Show error (already dispensed)
5. Display prescription details
6. User can click "Mark as Filled"
7. Status updates to "filled" with timestamp
```

### Error Handling:
- âœ… Prescription not found
- âœ… Already filled (prevents double dispensing)
- âœ… Firebase connection errors
- âœ… Missing prescription ID

## Testing

### To Test:
1. Doctor creates a prescription (status: "active")
2. Pharmacist enters ID and clicks "Verify" â†’ Status becomes "viewed"
3. Verify again â†’ Still shows details (status remains "viewed")
4. Click "Mark as Filled" â†’ Status becomes "filled"
5. Try to verify again â†’ Shows "ALREADY FILLED" error

### Check Firebase:
```javascript
// Query prescriptions by status
const activeQuery = query(prescriptions, where('status', '==', 'active'));
const viewedQuery = query(prescriptions, where('status', '==', 'viewed'));
const filledQuery = query(prescriptions, where('status', '==', 'filled'));
```

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions:
- Show "viewed by" pharmacist name
- Track multiple views (view count)
- Show time elapsed since viewing
- Alert if prescription viewed but not filled for X hours
- Analytics dashboard with status breakdowns
